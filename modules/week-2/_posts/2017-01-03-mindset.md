<p>In this section, we talk about how our Mindset sets us up for success.  Too often, we get stuck in the mindset that we are only good at one thing or that we are "talented" in only certain subjects.  Have you ever thought: "I am not a Math person" or "I just can't do that" whatever "that" is?  Well, that is not uncommon.  This kind of thinking is called the "Fixed Mindset."  We must take a look at this from a different perspective.  You can write a few sentences on Mindset in the <strong>discussion forum</strong>for week 2 on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1319350327383691366/1319350855346163794">discord</a> or you can chose to post on culture and learning - which we will learn about later in this module</p>
