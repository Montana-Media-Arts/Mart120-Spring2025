# Getting Help

## Help Quick Links

- [Discord Homework Channel](https://discord.gg/UVHEdnD9qS)
- [Email Cory McKague](mailto:cory.mckague@umt.edu?subject=120%20Question)

## Help Procedures

Do the following to get help with problems.

1. Look it up online and troubleshoot. 
    - As much as I am a resource, the best way to learn to code is to troubleshoot it and better understand the issue. Most of the software we use will often have their own forums.    
2. Post to the [Discord Homework Channel](https://discord.gg/UVHEdnD9qS).
    - Connect with your classmates through Discord. Odds are you aren't the only one struggling with the same issue. It creates comradery, helps others by troubleshooting together and with a lot more eyes looking at it, you might have your issue solved more quickly. 
3. Get help from [Cory McKague]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/)
    - If you have problems or need help that no one can offer, please contact Cory McKague (me, the one writing all of this).
    - The best way to get a hold of me is to shoot me an email. I try and get back to you within 24 hours, but this is a LARGE class. If you send me an email over the weekend, keep in mind, it might take longer.
